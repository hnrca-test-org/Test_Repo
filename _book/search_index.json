[["index.html", "HNRCA REDCap User Guide 1 Terminology", " HNRCA REDCap User Guide HNRCA Biostatistics and Data Management Core Unit 1 Terminology In Redcap, all the data associated with any given study can be found within a ‘project’. Within each project, participant data are contained in ‘records’. Records are generally linked to an HRNC ID. Data within a record are organized into ‘Instruments’, which are commonly referred to as ‘forms’. Within any given form, individual data points are stored in a ‘field’. Fields can also be referred to as ‘variables’.

Test change "],["navigating-projects.html", "3 Navigating Projects 3.1 Left-hand side bar 3.2 Locating record data 3.3 Redcap Tables", " 3 Navigating Projects Once you’ve logged into Redcap, you’ll be greeted with the ‘My Projects’ page. This page contains a list of all the projects you have access to. You can sort the projects by clicking any of the table headers (eg ‘Project Title’) or you can click the Organize button above the table to create folders and add your projects to them. 3.1 Left-hand side bar Once you’ve selected a project. You’ll be taken to that project’s home page. The project can navigated via the links in the left-hand side bar. The primary pages for accessing project data are under the Data Collection and Reports headings in the side bar. The Record Status Dashboard displays all project data (with optional filters) and the View / Edit Records or Add / Edit Records (will vary depending on your permissions) is used for navigating to individual records. The Reports are subsets of the project data meant for easy viewing. Also note the project status. This will generally say ‘Development’ or ‘Production’. Development means the project is still being revised and not yet ready for (real) data entry. When the project says Production, it has been finalized and is ready for entry of participant data. Additionally, at the top of the left-hand side bar is link to return to your projects page. 3.2 Locating record data 3.2.1 Finding individual records To go to an individual record within a project, click Add / Edit Records in the left-hand side bar. This link may appear differently depending on your permissions within the project. For example, if you don’t have permissions to create new records this link will be displayed as View / Edit Records. Once on the page you have several options for locating records in the project. If you know the subject’s HNRC ID, then you can select the drop-down in the Choose an existing HNRC ID field. Once you’ve selected the drop-down, you may also begin typing the ID number to jump to it in the list. If you have create records privileges, there will also be a box below that where you can enter a new or existing HNRC ID. This box will offer suggestion from existing IDs as you type, or you can enter a new one. Either of these methods will take you to a record’s Record Home Page. If you don’t know the subject’s ID number and need to search by name or other information, you can use the Data Search section of the page. If desired, you can select a specific field within the project to search. However, generally this is unnecessary and you can simply enter information into the Search query box. As you type, results will be displayed in a drop-down menu. Note that unlike typing in a subject’s ID number, clicking any of the results links will take you to the specific where that data was found. For example, if you are searching by name and names were collected at screening in the visit information form, that is where you’ll be taken. To navigate from there to a Record Home Page you can simply click the subject’s HNRC ID number in the left-hand side bar. Once on a form page for a particular record and event, the left-hand side bar will provide links for other forms within that event so that you can easily step through filling out information for a subject. Additionally, the ID number will be displayed above the form links. Clicking the ID number will take you back to that record’s Home Page. 3.2.2 Record Home Page The record home page displays a table showing all of data for a record. Each row of the table represents a data form, listed in the ‘Data Collection Instrument’ column, and each other column represents a visit, listed in the column headings. To access a data form, simply click on the status icon in the table corresponding to the form and visit you’re interested in. Additionally, any repeat forms (with data) will be listed below the table. 3.2.3 Record Status Dashboard Additionally, you can click the Record Status Dashboard link in the left-hand pane to view all of the study data in a single table. This table displays a record in each row (listed in the HNRC ID column) and the form/event combinations are displayed in the table columns. Once again, if you would like to go into a particular data form, simply click the status icon associated with the record and form you’re interested in. If you would like to view a Record Home Page, you can click the HNRC ID number in the first column. If you have create records privileges, you will also see a box above the table where you can enter a new HNRC ID number to create a new record. 3.3 Redcap Tables Redcap tables are found on both Record Home Page’s and the Record Status Dashboard. 3.3.1 Table colors Redcap tables are filled with status icons representing specific data forms. The color of the status icon represents the completion status of the form. A legend describing the status colors is displayed at the top right of any page with a table. If the icon is gray, that means that no data has been entered into the form. If data has been entered into the form, the icon will be colored according to the form status. The colors are red, yellow, and green which refer to a form status of incomplete, unverified, or complete, respectively. A form’s status is controlled manually by a special field at the end of every form. This means it is up to the users entering the data to the set the status of a form. Furthermore, if there is a repeating form where one or more of the repeats have a different status, the icon will be filled blue. 3.3.2 Table scrolling Another note about tables is scrolling. By default, tables are ‘floating’ and contain their own set of scroll bars, separate from the main page/browser scroll bars. If you find this cumbersome, you can click the gray Table not displaying properly link just above the table on the right-hand side. This will embed the table into the page so it does not have separate scroll bars. 3.3.3 Repeating forms Some forms can have more than one instance per event. In these cases, once data has been entered into a form, a plus sign will appear to the right of status icon. Clicking the plus sign will take you to a new instance of that form where you can enter new data. Once there are multiple instances of a form, the status icons will appear stacked. Clicking the icon stack will display a list of all of the form instances. Furthermore, once you’ve clicked on a form, there will be a Current instance drop down at the top of the page which allows you to switch between instances or create a new one. "],["entering-data.html", "4 Entering Data 4.1 Ensuring the form is correct 4.2 Saving data 4.3 Changing data 4.4 Hidden fields", " 4 Entering Data 4.1 Ensuring the form is correct The most important thing to do before ever entering data into a form is to check and make sure that the form you have open is for the correct HNRC ID, the correct event/visit, and the correct project. This information can all be found at the top of the page. The name of the project is displayed at the top of the page, while the HNRC ID and event/visit name are displayed at the top of the form. Often, participant names are displayed at the top of the form as well to help reduce confusion. Beyond being on the correct form, you’ll of course always want to take care to ensure that you’ve selected the corrected field for any given data point. Generally speaking, fields are horizontally aligned with their labels and there are thin, gray lines separating each field. 4.2 Saving data Once you’ve entered data into a form, you’ll want to make sure you save that form. There are several save options presented at the bottom of each form as well as floating save options at the top right of the page. Save &amp; Exit Form will save the data and return you to the record’s Home Page. Save &amp; Stay will save the data and keep you on the current page. Save &amp; Go To Next Form will save and advance you to the next form on the list in the left-hand side bar. In other words, you’ll be taken to the next form for that record at that event (visit). Cancel will remove any changes and return you to record’s Home Page. 4.3 Changing data If for any reason data in Redcap needs to be changed, one should be sure to leave a comment in Redcap explaining the reason for the change. Next to every data field in Redcap, there are a couple of icons. The comment icon is the one which resembles a speech bubble. If you click it, a pop-up will appear that will allow you to enter comments pertaining to that field. Note that these comment fields should be reserved for changes to data. Forms will typically have comment fields to capture general comments pertaining to the study. Additionally, next to the comment icon there is also an ‘H’ icon, which will display the history of all the data that has previously been entered in that field. 4.4 Hidden fields Be aware that some fields are hidden by default and will not appear until data is entered into another field. This can be used to clean up a form when all the fields aren’t always needed or when there are diverging sets of data to be collected depending on answers to previous questions. For example, if a subject doesn’t sign the study’s informed consent form, the fields collecting other information about the ICF such as the date, time, and approval may not appear. Another example would be pregnancy questions which may only appear if the subject is indicated to be female. "],["econsenting.html", "5 eConsenting 5.1 Accessing consents 5.2 Consenting process 5.3 Paper consenting", " 5 eConsenting 5.1 Accessing consents 5.1.1 Preferred method For studies with eConsenting (required IRB approval), the consent forms will appear alongside other forms in the Record Status Dashboard and record Home Pages. To consent a subject, you’ll need to open the associated survey on an iPad. To do this, click into the consent form then from the Survey Options drop-down at the top select Survey Access Code + QR Code. This will display a pop-up with the URL to navigate to on the iPad (https://redcap.hnrc.tufts.edu/surveys/). There will also be a direct link to this page on the iPad, which will be an icon called ‘Redcap Surveys’. You’ll also see a code, which should be entered into the iPad once the survey link is opened. You may also click Generate Short Code at the bottom to create a temporary shorter code. Entering the code will take you directly to the associated survey. You do not need to login to Redcap or navigate to the associated record. 5.1.2 Fallback method If you only have a single device with you when performing a consent (ie the iPad), the above method may not be feasible. As an alternative, you may access the consent by opening the Redcap link on the iPad, logging in, and navigating to the appropriate consent form as usual. However, rather than selecting Survey Access Code + QR Code from the Survey Options drop-down, you’ll want to select Log out + Open Survey. If using this method, it is critical that you log out prior to handing a participant the device. In addition, when logging in to Redcap on an iPad or other public device, your password should not be saved. 5.2 Consenting process Once the consent survey is open on the iPad, follow all normal consenting procedures as described in the Record of Consent form. The Record of Consent form is a repeating form and a new copy should be filled out for each consent performed. After reviewing the consent with the participant, the survey will contain the appropriate date, time, and signature fields that must be filled out. For the date and time fields, the ‘Today’ or ‘Now’ button next to the field may be used to quickly fill in the current date or time. To add signatures, click the Add Signature link and sign in the displayed signature box. This is preferably done on an iPad or other touchscreen device. Once these items are filled in, click the Next Page &gt;&gt; button at the bottom of the form. Under no circumstances should the Save &amp; Return Later option be used for consents. The following page will show a preview of the signed consent document for the subject to review. After double checking the document, the subject will need to check the box stating that the information in the document is correct. After that they may press Submit. This will save the consent form information, add a PDF copy of the consent to the File Repository, and proceed to the next consent if applicable. To print a copy of the consent for the participant, navigate to the File Repository by clicking the link in the left-hand side bar of the project in the ‘Applications’ section. From there you will see a folder called ‘PDF Survey Archive’. After clicking into the folder you will see a list of all eConsent documents associated with the study. Select the desired document to download a copy of the PDF and print via the device’s PDF viewer. If you’re unable to locate the document you’re looking for, you can sort the list by record IDs or the survey completion times by clicking the arrows at the top of the columns. 5.3 Paper consenting If for any reason eConsenting is not available or appropriate, you may default to a paper consent. To log a paper consent in Redcap, follow these steps: After completing the consent, scan the consent document to make a PDF copy. In the document name, include the subject’s name, HNRC ID, and the date and type of consent. It must be descriptive as files are not separated by subject. Navigate to the File Repository and click the ‘Paper Consents’ folder. If the folder does not exist, create a new one by clicking the Create folder button. Either drag the file into the drag and drop area at the top of the page, or click the Select files to upload button and navigate to the consent PDF. Navigate to the subject’s associated consent form. Near the top of the form there will be a comment field. Enter a note indicating that the consent was filled out in paper and include your name and date. Scroll to the bottom of the consent form and mark the form status as ‘Complete’, then save the form. This constitutes source document transfer and thus you may now destroy the original document.
