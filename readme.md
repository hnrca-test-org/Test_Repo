# Redcap User Guide Book

This is a user guide book built for HNRCA Redcap users. To view the book, open the [index.html](_book/index.html) file in the `_book/` directory. Note that index.html must be opened from within that directory to function properly.

The book was built via the bookdown package. To make edits, you'll want install the bookdown package, open the .Rproj file in Rstudio, and edit the index.Rmd file. The index.Rmd file contains all markdown for the book and images are stored in the `images/` folder. To rebuild the book after making edits, simply find the build pane and click `Build Book`. The book will then be displayed in the Rstudio viewer and the html files will be saved in the `_book/` directory.
